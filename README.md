# QuickScan

QuickScan is a mobile app that offers a streamlined end-to-end experience in scanning real-life objects into 3D! We simplify the photogrammetric process so that after a quick 2 minute guided video, we handle the input and return a 3D object within 5-10 minutes to download. This eliminates the need to spend 15-30 minutes taking photos and then another hour or so configuring software to get back an object.
